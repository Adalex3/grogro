# Snap.py

## Inspiration

How many times has your milk gone bad? Now think about how many times other people have had that experience. Simple occurrences like this contribute to an overarching problem of food waste, and we wanted to develop an application to help reduce that, as well as aid in other grocery-associated tasks. Our name, "Snap.py", conveys the snappy speed of our tool to aid future shopping trips as well as plays on it being a homophone to "snap pea" and formatted like a Python file name.
